			Our newest project that we currently working on is an anti-bullying APP for mobile smartphones. The APP is called TAB (short for Together Against Bullying) and it’s is going to be absolutely free for everyone to use. It is still under development and release date is not yet decided but we’re planning to release it during summer of 2017.
		</p>
	
		<br>
		<p>
			Growing numbers of cases of bullying and cyberbullying is worrisome and has to be acknowledged. The reason behind the idea for this APP is that often victims of bullying are not reporting the problem and as result of that, there comes no resolution to the problem. Our app is going to provide the possibility for the victims to have a voice (anonymous or not) in difficult situations when bullying takes place. 
		</p>
		<br>
	
			<p>
				There are four major features that TAB application has:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Report of bullying – makes it possible for the victim to report the problem. If the victim is a student, then the report is going to be automatically sent directly to school counsellor. The school counsellor is then going to follow school procedures for bullying and conflict resolving. The reporting itself consists of filling out a text field with the information describing the accident. There will be a possibility to have attachments. It is up to the user if the report is going to be anonymously or not.</li>
				
				<li>Counseling – this option provides the victim with possibility to send an enquiry to Together Against Bullying in order to arrange a meeting and get the necessary help to solve the situation. In this case, the user has to fill out a simple form and give us necessary information so that we can step in and help.</li>
				<li>Emergency call – this useful feature will big of great use for people that are desperate and need to talk to someone who can help. The calls are going to be taken by one of our assistants here at Together Against Bullying and it is up to the user if he chooses to stay anonymous.</li>

				<li>Reporting images on social media – makes it possible to report images with inappropriate content on social media. This feature uses special kind of metadata that has been developed specially for this. In order to use this feature the user has to have a direct link to the image that he/she wants to report and remove from social media. The user pastes the link in special field in the app and sends it to us at Together Against Bullying. Our role in this is talk to the social website on behalf of the user. If the problem does not stop then metadata can be used to track the source of the problem, the bully himself.
				<p>
					"This is a complex feature and still needs a lot of work in order to work properly. The metadata has to be developed and in the near future, there has to be a legislation in place that makes this metadata a standard that all manufacturers of video and photo cameras has to follow. The metadata has to be permanently implemented in all images to make full use of this feature."
				</p>
				</li>
				
			</ul>
